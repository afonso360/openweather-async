# openweather-async

This rust library is used to access **Current Weather** portion of the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/). It is not an official library, and was created with reference to a synchronous version found [here](https://github.com/BroderickCarlin/openweather). 

## usage
To use this library you will need to first sign up at [OpenWeather API Sign up](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up) and get an API key. If interested, the API documentation is shown [here](https://openweathermap.org/current) with examples of the json-formatted response.
